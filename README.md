## Project Overview
The Farmland Avian Monitoring Program was launched in 2019 with the purpose of connecting sustainable land use practices with changes in native bird communities. Our team is particularly interested in species that provide ecosystem services or are of conservation concern. To date, we have completed four survey seasons at five organic farms in Ford County, Illinois. 

## Enrolled Farms
- Cow Creek (400 acres) <br />
- Craver Trust (200 acres) <br />
- D & Q (80 acres) <br />
- J & W (160 acres) <br />
- R Wildflower & Fields (160 acres) <br />
